We are excited to announce that the Hall Lab team will be participating in the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) Annual Meeting 2024, where we will present three highlighted posters:

- **Board 4044W**: *Flexibly encoded genome-wide association study identifies novel nonadditive genetic risk variants for cardiometabolic traits*. This innovative study uses a flexible approach to identify novel nonadditive genetic risk variants associated with cardiometabolic traits.
