CLARITE version 2 has been released. Full release notes are available in the [documentation](https://clarite-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release-history.html), but the main improvement is support for genotype data and simplification of the analysis functions to better support a variety of association and interaction tests.  
Support for genotype data is possible though the use of [Pandas-Genomics](https://pandas-genomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), another project of the Hall Lab.
